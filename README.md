# ML-Project-with-Cathay-Life

## Overview
This project is part of the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence course in collaboration with **Cathay Life**. In this project, we work on real-world problems in the financial and healthcare industries using machine learning methods.

Our task focuses on predicting heart disease based on key health indicators collected by the **CDC** through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Using machine learning models, we aim to identify important risk factors and improve prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
- **Source**: CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
- **Data Description**:  
  - 2022 annual survey data from 400,000+ adults.
  - Dataset with 40 relevant variables linked to heart disease risk.
  - Binary target variable: `HadHeartAttack` ("Yes" or "No").
  - Class imbalance exists â€” techniques like resampling and class weight adjustment are needed.

## Goals
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Apply and compare classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
- Handle class imbalance properly.
- Identify key variables affecting heart disease likelihood.
